Here is how this choice aligns with my future:
Bridging Science and Empathy: I am driven by the complexity of human biology and the potential to solve health challenges. Medicine allows me to apply scientific knowledge in a practical, hands-on environment where I can make a tangible difference in a patient's wellbeing [1, 2].
Long-Term Impact and Service: The ""why"" behind my choice is the opportunity to foster long-term patient relationships and act as a pillar of support during critical moments. This aligns with my future goal of becoming a reliable, compassionate, and knowledgeable healthcare provider [1, 2].
Lifelong Learning and Growth: The medical field is constantly evolving. A UG-MED degree is the foundational step for a future of continuous learning, research, and adaptation to new medical advancements, ensuring I can provide the best possible care throughout my career [1, 2]. 
Ultimately, choosing UG-MED is not just about a career path; it is about choosing a life of service that aligns with my values of empathy, intellectual curiosity, and community, setting the stage for a fulfilling future in medicine [1]. 
Choosing Undergraduate Medical Education (UG-MED) is driven by a desire to merge scientific intellectual stimulation with the profoundly human, compassionate work of healing. It is a proactive, life-long learning path chosen to directly impact patient lives, offering the unique opportunity to turn abstract scientific knowledge into tangible care.",18-Feb-2026 11:55:33,New Record  -  Record added,https://letsenterprise.in/,letsenterprise.in@gmail.com,

Our vibe? Effortless. I’m not just answering questions; I’m anticipating the friction in your day and smoothing it out before you even feel it. Whether I’m sitting in your smart-glasses or managing your household energy grid to save you a few bucks, I’m faster, funnier, and much more intuitive.
Think of me as the CEO of your digital chaos, keeping everything running so you can actually enjoy being human.
Do you want to see a day-in-the-life schedule of how we'd tackle your current Monday routine in 2030","Global Opportunities: A medical degree provides a ""passport"" to work anywhere in the world. Due to the uniformity of medical knowledge, graduates can find opportunities in various countries.
Specialization and Growth: After the foundational 5.5-year MBBS, the degree opens doors to over 60 specialties (e.g., pediatrics, surgery, radiology), allowing for a personalized career path.
Financial Stability: While requiring hard work, a career in medicine provides a high salary scale and financial security, which increases with experience.
Personal Development and Leadership: The rigorous training develops resilience, communication skills, and team management capabilities, equipping you for leadership roles in hospitals or health organizations.
Answering the Need for Healthcare Providers: The field fits a future dedicated to addressing the global shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural or underserved communities.

Reading helps me slow down and gain perspective. Cooking keeps me present and joyful, while travelling broadens my worldview and has taught me that happiness is shaped by perspective.","I contributed to The Cultural Mosaic as an assistant Kathak teacher, independently teaching diverse age groups, leading distinction-achieving batches, contributing to choreography, design, and the institute’s first national tour.","Being schooled with the beliefs of Madhavi Kapoor and under CIE, I value the importance of hands-on learning and hope to find something just as meaningful for my undergraduate years.","Five years from now, I see myself living a life that feels intentional rather than monotonous-one I genuinely look forward to waking up to each day. My mornings begin calmly, with time for dance practice and a good breakfast enjoyed at home, setting a grounded tone for the day. I want my life to strike a balance between freedom and stability, giving me the space to explore ideas, take initiative, and grow, while also having a strong sense of structure and direction-something I see UG-MED preparing me for through its emphasis on self-driven, real-world learning.
Working in a field that combines my strengths with my passions is central to this vision, as it allows me to remain motivated and engaged over the long term. One way I see myself moving towards this is by working in a field closely associated with dance, such as gradually building towards running my own academy. During and after UG-MED, I hope to increase the frequency of posting dance covers on my YouTube channel and gain wider teaching experience by working with schools as a dance teacher. The exposure to practical projects, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving through UG-MED would help me grow organically, refine my skills, and better understand how to turn passion into sustainable work without constant stress around deadlines or competition.
In this future, dance plays a grounding role in my everyday life through regular practice, teaching, and as a form of expression during overwhelming moments. Evenings are spent unwinding through cooking, reading, and sharing meals with my family, helping me stay balanced and present. Ultimately, what I hope to be most proud of is having built a life with a healthy work–life balance, where I enjoy going to work rather than dreading it, and where my professional choices reflect the values and perspective shaped during my time at UG-MED.","My long-term goal is to build my own dance academy-one that allows students to experience the traditional beauty of dance through a modern lens, helping them connect to their roots in a way that feels relevant to their lives today. In my generation, classical arts are often dismissed as outdated, and I want to challenge that perception by showing that tradition is not something that holds us back, but something that helps us grow.
To work towards this goal as an entrepreneur, I believe learning must extend beyond lectures and theoretical instruction. Building something of my own will require real-world exposure, adaptability, and the ability to make practical decisions in changing situations. Alongside artistic skill, I recognise the need to develop leadership, community-building, communication, and business sense to clearly convey my vision and build something sustainable.
UG-MED aligns strongly with this future because of its emphasis on hands-on learning, teamwork, real projects with companies, and internships. These experiences will allow me to strengthen my communication skills through real interactions with people and ideas, while also helping me understand how to apply concepts in practice rather than in isolation. The programme’s experiential approach will enable me to experiment, learn from mistakes, and refine my thinking in real time.
I also see myself actively applying what I learn at UG-MED alongside my work in dance, whether by understanding how to work with people, building meaningful campaigns, or exploring creative ways to engage younger audiences. Through UG-MED, I hope to gain the skills, confidence, and perspective needed to turn my passion for dance into a sustainable, impactful venture.",18-Jan-2026 14:31:40,New Record  -  Record added,,letsenterprise.in@gmail.com,

The focus on purpose-driven leadership and global perspective aligns perfectly with my vision of learning through doing.","It’s March 2030. I’m standing in my studio-office, the kind that smells like fresh fabric and new ideas. Outside, a small hydroponic garden blooms on the terrace, feeding both my love for sustainability and my morning smoothie routine.
I’m the founder of a purpose-driven fashion and lifestyle brand that upcycles Indian textiles into global designs, a continuation of the project that began back in high school with discarded sarees. But now, it’s more than a venture; it’s a movement empowering hundreds of women artisans across India to build financial independence through creativity.
In the corner of my workspace, a football sits beside a framed photo of the Divyang kids I once coached, a reminder of where it all began. Every weekend, I still visit them, organising community games and mentorship sessions. That part of me, the player, the coach, the changemaker, will never fade.
My day starts with team huddles that feel like family meetings, designers, marketers, and strategists all aligned toward one vision: to prove that profit and purpose can coexist. Between calls with investors and brainstorming campaigns, I find time to write blogs, short reflections, maybe even the early pages of a book about social entrepreneurship.
By evening, I walk onto the football field again, this time not to compete, but to remind myself of the discipline and joy that shaped my journey.","My “why” for choosing UG-MED comes from a deep desire to build businesses that don’t just sell, they solve, empower, and sustain.
Through my journey from founding Divyang, an NGO teaching blind children football, to upcycling 300 discarded sarees into reusable products that empowered 30 women, I realised that entrepreneurship can be the most powerful tool for change. But to truly create lasting impact, I need to blend business strategy, human-centred design, and purpose-driven leadership, exactly what UG-MED stands for.
The program’s hands-on approach and focus on innovation align perfectly with how I learn best by doing. I want to explore how sustainability, marketing, and entrepreneurship can intersect to create scalable solutions for social good.
UG-MED isn’t just a degree for me, it’s the foundation to build ventures that reflect my values: inclusion, creativity, and impact.",12-Nov-2025 10:24:04,New Record  -  Record added,https://letsenterprise.in/,letsenterprise.in@gmail.com,

After fourteen years of schooling, most students cannot even earn their own pocket money. This creates a significant gap in our society, often leading them to seek opportunities abroad. From my experiences, I’ve recognized the need and the chance to fill that gap.

However, when I examined the syllabus of traditional programs, I found them uninteresting. What really inspired me were undergraduate programs that provide practical learning beyond regular teaching.

I want to build creative ventures,solve real-world problems n surround myself with ambitious peers who think beyond tradition","It's March 2030, I am 23 years old and leading my own business venture that I started right after college. It's a growing company driven by creativity, innovation, and a passion to solve real-world problems especially for young people like me who think differently and want to build something meaningful.

I wake up excited every day knowing I have the freedom to create, lead, and take bold risks. I work with a passionate team that believes in the same vision  to build not just a profitable company, but a purposeful one.

Outside of work, I’m speaking at youth entrepreneurship events, meeting interesting people, constantly learning, staying fit, and enjoying a lifestyle I once dreamed of. I’ve grown not just professionally, but also as a person — more confident, focused, and self-aware.

This life is the result of choosing a different path, learning through experiences, taking initiative, and never settling for average. And I know this is just the beginning.","I chose UG-MED because it aligns perfectly with how I want to learn and grow — through action, experimentation, and real-world exposure.

I am 23 years old.

The city is already buzzing when I step out — the kind of organized chaos only an Indian metro can master. I still  live in Bangalore - it’s where India’s tech heart beats the loudest. Five years ago, I was 18, tinkering with code and sketching out a vision for a fintech product that would make money simpler, more human, and more inclusive.

Today, that vision is FinVerse — an AI-powered financial ecosystem serving small businesses, gig workers, and Gen Z users who never trusted traditional banks. We’ve just launched our first global pilot in Southeast Asia, and we're getting love from communities that have long been invisible to big finance.

My day kicks off with a sync call with our product team. We're finalizing a feature that helps small grocery store owners predict cash flow and get instant credit. The team is half engineers, half designers, all obsessed with building clean, intuitive tools that solve real problems.

At lunch, I meet with a senior RBI official — we’re discussing how to shape policy for embedded finance that actually works on the ground. I used to be nervous at meetings like this. Now, I feel like I belong. I’ve earned this seat.

Afternoons are when I shift into deep work mode — product strategy, data reviews, partnerships. The noise fades, and I remember why I started this in the first place: to make finance less about numbers and more about people.

My evenings are messy — a mix of demo nights, tech meetups, late-night prototyping, and spontaneous ideation sessions over filter coffee. Some days I crash from the intensity. Other days, I stay up till 2 a.m. sketching out the next bold feature.

And honestly? I wouldn't trade it for anything.","I want to build something that changes how people interact with money. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems, and the intersection of finance and technology is where I see the most opportunity for innovation and impact.
From a young age, I’ve been fascinated by how startups can disrupt industries — especially in a country like India, where millions still lack access to basic financial tools. I’ve seen how small changes in how we save, borrow, or invest can transform lives. That’s why I’m drawn to fintech — it’s not just about apps or algorithms; it’s about financial inclusion, empowerment, and creating scalable systems that work for everyone.In the next 5–10 years, I see myself running a fintech venture that tackles a specific pain point — whether it’s credit access for young people, smarter budgeting tools for Tier 2 cities, or transparent lending for small businesses.",01-Jul-2025 21:25:12,New Record  -  Record added,,letsenterprise.in@gmail.com,

During my time at the university, I launched a startup that has now grown steadily. We recently secured our Series B funding, which has opened up new opportunities for expansion and innovation. Beyond my own venture, I have been actively exploring industries I am truly passionate about, including food and beverage, renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable green solutions like solar and organic waste systems. These areas not only align with my values but also present opportunities to create real impact. At the moment, I am gaining hands-on experience by working in different roles across these fields, building the knowledge and insight I will need to start another business within the next two to three years. I have also made it a priority to keep learning and evolving, whether through formal training, mentorship, or by staying curious and involved in the ecosystem. Thanks to the practical approach and the incredible network I built at Let's Enterprise, I feel well prepared and motivated for what lies ahead.","I chose UG-MED at Let's Enterprise because I prefer practical learning over theoretical approaches. In Ahmedabad, most colleges focus on traditional classroom teaching, but UG-MED stands out with its industry-oriented curriculum. My goal is to start my own business, and I believe this program will give me the knowledge and connections I need to succeed.

My special favourite is also playing and exploring new games that involve strategy and logic, some of my favourites include Chess, Mastermind and Monopoly.","As part of a design challenge, I created a simple business plan for providing healthy, affordable food to hostel students, inspired by my sister’s experience. Over 5 days, I explored stakeholder needs, market scenario, and the math, along with my sister.","In a world of growing AI, I want to stay connected to human growth and development. UG-MED will help me identify my natural business skills and grow through real-life projects not by teaching creativity, but by letting me experience it firsthand.","The dream I have right now is to be equipped with sufficient skills and some amount of experience to help me begin my own business, one that aims to provide a much-needed solution to a problem or gap I identify through the thought process and skills I learn at Let’s Enterprise. Hopefully, I will have made it through the first two years of the difficult yet exciting phase of a start-up, made a whole bunch of mistakes, learned from them, and begun to map the growth phase of my start-up.
The idea of having my own business comes from several facets of my personality and my experiences so far. I want to build a holistic atmosphere at my workplace, form meaningful connections with the people around me, and ensure that my business, in some sense, adds to the lives of my customers.
I also want to be independent (in whatever way possible) in a volatile job market, by providing some stability to myself and to those who are with me. These are the dreams I have and hopefully, I can achieve them someday. I also want to be able to adapt; in case my business fails, I want to be prepared to handle failure.","What draws me to UG-MED is the freedom it offers to explore different paths, and the real-world opportunities it provides. I believe it will equip me with practical, hands-on skills to eventually start my own business, building on what I’ve already learned. These are skills I can always carry with me tools that will open up a wide range of career possibilities and allow me to adapt to the continuous change in the job market. It’s not just about getting a job, but about having the ability and confidence to create opportunities for myself and maybe even for others.
For example, an idea that I have currently (though this could develop and change over time): my family owns a farm, and I’ve often thought about doing something meaningful with that space in the future. One of my ideas is to use what I learn at UG-MED to create a business opportunity on the farm that is self-sufficient ecosystem that allows me to host, feed, and provide a novel experience for people. I’d love to find ways to host and entertain people, create memorable experiences for them, and build a sustainable and welcoming space that reflects who I am. UG-MED feels like the right step toward making all of that possible.
I believe Let’s Enterprise could teach me the realities of business, including decision-making, and connect me with experts in the industry from whom I can learn valuable lessons. Joining a college usually involves first learning (mostly theory) and then applying it later. With Let’s Enterprise, I will be learning, making mistakes, and gaining experience in the real world all at the same time. Another bonus is the chance to integrate and network within the business community at an early age, build my personal brand, and gain exposure to many of the key ingredients required to start my own entrepreneurial journey.",22-Jun-2025 23:11:30,New Record  -  Record added,,letsenterprise.in@gmail.com,

My day starts early — not because I have to, but because I want to. I’m up at 6:30 a.m., making my day plan and Journaling  while reviewing user data from the latest app update. We just rolled out a new feature that helps users round up their daily purchases and automatically invest the spare change into diversified portfolios. Think investing made so simple that even a 16-year-old could start, honestly and many of them are. We named our company nivesha ( means investment in Hindi)
When I was 18, I was tired of how complicated banking and investing seemed — so I built the solution I wished I had.
I’ve got a team of few people  — engineers, product designers, compliance .

Now in 2030, we have 6 million users, mostly between the ages of 18–30. We’ve helped users invest over ₹1,200 crore collectively and raised a ₹40 crore seed round from two major Indian VCs who believe in financial access for everyone — not just the urban elite.We work with schools, colleges, and youth organizations to spread financial literacy. We even have a gamified learning module in local languages — Hindi, Tamil, Bengali — because real change starts with access and understanding.
I spend most of my time leading product meetings, talking to regulators, and onboarding partnerships with UPI providers and government-backed financial inclusion programs. My vision is to make Nivesha the go-to app for every young Indian who wants to escape the paycheck-to-paycheck trap and build wealth the smart way.","My “why” for choosing UG-med  is simple: I want to build something that solves real problems, and I believe business is the foundation for turning ideas into impact.
